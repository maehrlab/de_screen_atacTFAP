This folder contains scripts used for atacTFAP analysis in our recent definitive endoderm screen. (For analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, there is a separate repo.) You can find the data at [GEO: GSE127202](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE127202). atacTFAP analysis was conceived and implemented by Michael Ziller.
